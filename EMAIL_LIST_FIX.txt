🔧 EMAIL LIST & MASTER PAGE FIXES
====================================

ISSUES FIXED:
-------------
1. ✅ Email List View showing blank page
   - Problem: react-window <List> component had wrong props
   - Wrong: listRef, rowCount, rowHeight, rowComponent
   - Fixed: ref, itemCount, itemSize, height, width, children

2. ✅ Master page missing skeleton loader
   - Added CardSkeleton component during initial load
   - Replaced full-page PageLoader with inline skeleton cards
   - Better UX - shows layout structure while loading

FILES UPDATED:
--------------
1. frontend/src/pages/EmailsListOptimized.jsx
   - Fixed List component props:
     * ref={listRef} (was listRef={listRef})
     * height={600} (required by react-window)
     * width="100%" (required by react-window)
     * itemCount={filteredEmails.length} (was rowCount)
     * itemSize={60} (was rowHeight)
     * {EmailRow} as children (was rowComponent prop)

2. frontend/src/pages/Master.jsx
   - Added import: CardSkeleton component
   - Replaced: PageLoader with CardSkeleton (3 cards)
   - Shows skeleton cards during initial load
   - Maintains page structure while loading

BUILD STATUS:
-------------
✓ Build successful (21.92s)
✓ No errors or warnings
✓ All chunks optimized

WHAT TO DO:
-----------
1. Upload updated frontend/dist folder to server
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Test:
   - Click "View" on any email list
   - Should see emails loading with skeleton
   - Master page shows skeleton cards during load

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------
react-window List requires:
- height: number or string (pixels or percentage)
- width: number or string (pixels or percentage)  
- itemCount: number of items to render
- itemSize: height of each item in pixels
- children: render function or component

The blank page was caused by missing required props,
causing react-window to not render anything.
